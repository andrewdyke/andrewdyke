How-To-Fix-Line6-M5

Since grounding is through the metal case, you must scrape all paint away from the five external screw holes, 
including the one on the side and replace with unpainted screws. AND most important: take off the case and 
lightly sand or file the bottoms of the two threaded metal tubes that two of the external screws thread into 
to support the circuit board, as well as where the tubes touch the inside of the case. These actions will 
correct the poor design by Line 6 which created the intermittent grounding problem. Line 6 should have 
acknowledged the design or production flaw in an otherwise good product.
